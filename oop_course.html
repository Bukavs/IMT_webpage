                <h2>Course Shortcomings: A Critical Overview</h2>
                <p>Our Object Oriented Programming course has several shortcomings that need to be addressed. The course
                    material is outdated, the examples used are not relevant to current industry practices, and the
                    assignments do not effectively reinforce the concepts taught in lectures. Additionally, the course
                    lacks sufficient hands-on projects that would help students gain practical experience.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>First Week: A Rocky Start</h2>
                <p>The first week of our Object Oriented Programming course was cancelled, which set a negative tone for
                    the rest of the semester. This unexpected cancellation caused confusion and disrupted our learning
                    schedule, making it difficult to catch up on the missed material.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>Second Week: Technical Troubles</h2>
                <p>The second week of our Object Oriented Programming course was equally frustrating. We spent two hours
                    watching an Ubuntu installation screen with frequent breaks every 20 minutes. This was not an
                    effective use of our time, and many students encountered errors and problems during the installation
                    process. Approximately 70% of the students faced issues, and we had to persuade the instructor to
                    cancel some graded assignments due to these widespread problems.</p>
                <p>I have to note that what the previous writer just told you about was described in the course
                    description as the task for <a href="#week-1">04.02.2025</a> @odo. However, the instructions given
                    back then differed from what he was showing on screen. Referring back to his documentation, it could
                    be now seen that he has TWO different instructions on setting up the work environment with
                    differences along the way -- in one of them, the main work repo was downloaded as a .zip file, in
                    the other -- it was cloned from his given link.</p>
                <p>Some of the parts of his tutorials were straight-up not possible to do anymore -- like modifying the
                    /etc/apt/sources.list file which is no longer present on Xubuntu 24.04, his recommended system -- or
                    even malicious -- like removing the update-manager and the snap package manager. One of the students
                    noted that their Firefox installation was gone after they deleted snap. Tough luck.</p>
                <p>Also, the teacher spent about 5 minutes of our time explaining that Linux is much more superior
                    compared to Windows. Refer to the time code 13:13 of the first lecture <a
                        href="https://youtu.be/LpAVOYqRi1g&t=793">here</a>. This will become relevant on the <a
                        href="#week-5">5th week</a>. Someone should backup his recordings in case they get deleted... //
                    done</p>
                <p>During the second week, we spent 3 hours installing Xubuntu on virtual machines. The reason for this
                    was that the instructor's automated tests and unit tests rely on GNU core utilities, which are
                    primarily available on GNU/Linux systems. This incompatibility with Windows and macOS systems
                    necessitated the use of Xubuntu.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>Third Week: IDE Confusion</h2>
                <p>The third week started with the teacher continuing to explain how to set up the work environment,
                    including downloading the JDK and Maven packages, setting up the cloned project, and demonstrating
                    how to work in it. Despite the instructions advising the use of Eclipse IDE, the teacher used
                    IntelliJ IDEA because he "prefers it," which confused many students who followed the original
                    instructions.</p>
                <p>When showing how to get IntelliJ IDEA, the teacher downloaded the .tar.gz archive and installed the
                    program using this method. Using the command to install it with snap was not an option, considering
                    that the <a href="#snap-bad">snap package manager should be removed</a>. When the teacher attempted
                    to show the Eclipse IDE, he realized that the JUnit tests did not run. Instead of providing a proper
                    solution, he demonstrated how to run the tests using the terminal, leaving Eclipse users in a
                    difficult position.</p>
                <p>For the next 30 minutes, the teacher struggled to launch the projects with both IDEs. Eventually, he
                    decided to show us how to connect to his SSH server. The passwords to the SSH server were provided
                    in a format that included the student's ID, which meant that if someone had another student's ID
                    number, they could easily log in and change the password, causing issues for the affected student.

                <h2>Fourth Week: Questionable Responses</h2>
                <p>The fourth week was quite uneventful in terms of lecture content, but the responses to our questions
                    were quite memorable. The instructor's replies included statements like "luck favors the strong,"
                    "only a fool thinks that plans can be implemented without any adjustments," "But in general it is
                    considered bad programmer, who can't manage to get decent hardware for her/him-self," and "Please
                    clarify your question, otherwise it just looks like hallucinated garbage." These responses left many
                    of us feeling frustrated and disrespected.</p>

                <h2>Fifth Week: Testing Turmoil</h2>
                <h3>1st Lecture: ChatGPT in Action</h3>
                <p>Nothing of note in particular, except for the fact that the teacher decided to use ChatGPT to
                    generate code for activity04, which is needed to complete activity05. Refer to the time code 45:23
                    of the fourth lecture <a href="https://youtu.be/yLA3bENmenQ?t=2723">here</a>.</p>
                <h3>2nd Lecture: The Test Debacle</h3>
                <p>What a disaster...</p>
                <h4>Test Format: A Messy Affair</h4>
                <p>The test took place on his odo platform and not E-Studijas, which has relatively decent test options.
                    The test page itself consisted of two fields for the student identifier and all the answers, and a
                    submit button.</p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="/test-page.png" width="50%" alt="Odo test page">
                    <figcaption>Odo test page</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>The answers had to be in the exact format "2=a" otherwise you got 0 points for the
                    question. The questions themselves were provided as a non-copyable PDF file, so basically an image.
                    Also, he basically answered the first 3 questions at the start of the lecture, so you could just
                    copy-paste them.</p>
                </p>
                <h4>Test Questions: A Mixed Bag</h4>
                <p>Not all tests are created equal. Some questions were actually about the course material or Java, even
                    though they were written in broken English. Some questions were unrelated to OOP, such as his server
                    IP address, his git repository, and so on. And then there were questions 20 and 21.</p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="/q20-q21.png" width="50%" alt="Questions 20 and 21">
                    <figcaption>Questions 20 and 21</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>One could argue that all answers are correct, but no, as V.V. said -- "teacher is always right," and
                    in this case, the correct answers for question 20 is (c) and for question 21 is (a) as was mentioned
                    in the first lecture.</p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="/teacher-always-right.png" width="50%" alt="Teacher is always right">
                    <figcaption>Teacher is always right</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <h4>Post-test Review: More Confusion</h4>
                <p>After the test ended, he went through all the questions and wasted even more time (approximately 30
                    minutes) on saying the correct answers to all of the questions. He tried to copy-paste and compile
                    question 30 three times, failed to do so, said that it should have compiled and the correct answer
                    to question 3 is (c), failed to elaborate, and ended the lecture 30 minutes early.</p>

                <h2>Sixth Week: Attendance Drop and Bizarre Tasks</h2>
                <p>The attendance dropped from approximately 100 students to 38. We were also assigned a bizarre task
                    where we had to implement classes with methods like <code>vomit()</code> and
                    <code>killHimself()</code>. I wonder if LU even allows this by law.
                </p>

            <section>
                <h2>Ongoing Concerns</h2>
                <p>The course is not over yet, and we are increasingly concerned about the quality of the remaining
                    lectures and assignments. This course is mandatory, and its current state is causing significant
                    stress and frustration among students. We hope that the issues will be addressed promptly to ensure
                    a better learning experience for everyone involved.</p>
